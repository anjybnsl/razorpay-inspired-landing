# razorpay-inspired-landing
A modern Razorpay-inspired landing page built using HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS and JavaScript. Fully responsive with sections like hero, features, product highlights, and footer.

This project is a single-page landing website inspired by the modern, professional design of the Razorpay homepage. The structure, colour palette (Indigo and Violet accents), and key components (Hero, Features Grid, Split Product Highlights) are derived from the reference, but the content and branding are unique to the fictional "QuickPay" platform.

# Project Structure and Design Highlights

●	Brand Identity: QuickPay, a unified financial stack platform.

●	Aesthetics: Clean, minimalist design with strong use of whitespace and typography (Inter font).

●	Color Scheme: Primary colors are Indigo (indigo-600) and Violet (violet-600), contrasting with a light background (bg-gray-50 / bg-white).

●	Responsiveness: Fully responsive using Tailwind's utility-first approach (md:, lg: prefixes).

●	Visual Mockups: Simplified mockups for a dashboard/API code block are included to enhance the professional feel.


# Frameworks/Libraries Used

●	HTML5: Core page structure.

●	Tailwind CSS (v3+): Used via CDN for all styling and responsiveness utilities.

●	JavaScript (Vanilla): Minimal use for toggling the mobile navigation menu functionality.

●	Google Fonts: Inter (for clean, modern typography).


# Setup Instructions

This project is delivered as a single, self-contained HTML file.

1.	Save the file: Save the code block content as index.html.
   
2.	Open in Browser: Open the index.html file directly using your web browser (e.g., right-click -> "Open with...").
   
Since the HTML includes the Tailwind CSS CDN link, no separate build step or local installation is required for viewing.
